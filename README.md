# Big Party Frames

Big Party Frames changes the default party frames to use the style of Player's Frame, giving a better view of the party health and resources. Additionally, this addon shows buffs and debuffs next to the party frames.

_This product is still in development_

I'm testing the addon myself and I think it is in a good position to be at least published as experimental, but keep in mind that there might be bug and issues. Please report any issue you might encounter while using the addon :)

Roadmap:
- Different border for debuffs for easier dispell.
- Green border if buff is given by the player.
- Filter for unwanted buffs/debuffs.
